## Dedicated_Micro_Sorting
    Quatus Porject for Sorting data using Dediated Microprocesor

# About
    This project is for final project of class (010113025) DIGITAL CIRCUIT & LOGIC DESIGN Semester2/2019 KMUTNB.
    The Project is studying about Dedicated Microprocessor i.e. Sorting Microprocessor. 
    In this project we use Insertion Sort Algorithm which give us the best case at 50 Clcoks and the worst case at 116 Clocks, the performance depends on type of input.

# Compatibility
    Data Input : 8-bit 2's Complement
    Assending / Dessending : 1 = Assending , 0 = Dessending
    Software Recommend : Quatus8.1
